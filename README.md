## notes
1. In this [https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/2013-snapshot](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/2013-snapshot) just provide advanced account register. If you want to register a basic account, should go to [https://data.crunchbase.com/page/basic-access-form](https://data.crunchbase.com/page/basic-access-form). Further, better use Gmail to register account. If you use another e-mail, you may lose their reply.
2. I can not visited [http://graphql.org](http://graphql.org), but I get their source code from [here](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io). I read their documents and example from this.
3. The example of flask-graphql provide by graphene is discarded and did not work well. I get the right usage from [here](https://github.com/graphql-python/flask-graphql)
